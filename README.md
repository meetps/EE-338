## Filter Specifications

### Filter 1 
* Filter type: Band Pass.
* Passband tolerance = 0.15 (in magnitude).
* Stopband tolerance = 0.15 (in magnitude).
* Transition band = 2 KHz on either side of band.
* Pass band type = equiripple.
* Stop band type = monotonic.
* Sampling frequency = 100 kHz.
* Signal Bandlimit = 45 kHz
* Passband low limit, B_l = 13.6 kHz.
* Passband high limit, B_h = 23.6 kHz.

### Filter 2
* Filter type: Band Stop.
* Passband tolerance = 0.15 (in magnitude).

* Transition band = 2 KHz on either side of band.
* Pass band type = monotonic.
* Stop band type = monotonic.
* Sampling frequency = 100 kHz.
* Signal Bandlimit = 45 kHz.
* Passband high limit, BH(m) = 25.2 kHz.
* Passband low limit, BL(m) = 15.2 kHz.
